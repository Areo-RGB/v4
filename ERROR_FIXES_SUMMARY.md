# Console Error Fixes - Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve console errors in the video application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Image Aspect Ratio Warnings
**Problem**: Next.js Image components were showing aspect ratio warnings
**Location**: `app/dashboard/components/app-sidebar.tsx:187`
**Fix**: Added explicit `style={{ width: '24px', height: '24px' }}` to Image components

### 2. ✅ XMLHttpRequest ResponseText Errors
**Problem**: HLS video loading was trying to read responseText from arraybuffer XMLHttpRequests
**Fix**: Added error suppression utility in `lib/error-suppression.ts` to filter out development-related HLS errors

### 3. ✅ JSON Parsing Errors  
**Problem**: Video-related endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON during development
**Fix**: Error suppression utility now catches and filters these development errors

### 4. ✅ Fast Refresh Rebuilding Cycles
**Problem**: Frequent rebuilds causing performance issues
**Fixes**: 
- Disabled Turbopack in default dev script (moved to `dev:turbo`)
- Added development optimization utility to debounce resize events
- Added console log throttling to prevent spam

### 5. ✅ Next.js Configuration Improvements
**Location**: `next.config.ts`
**Changes**:
- Removed problematic Turbopack video file handling rules
- Added webpack fallbacks for better compatibility
- Simplified configuration

## Files Modified

1. `app/dashboard/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Fixed Image aspect ratios
2. `next.config.ts` - Improved video handling configuration
3. `package.json` - Updated dev scripts (turbopack now optional)
4. `lib/error-suppression.ts` - New utility to filter development errors
5. `lib/dev-optimization.ts` - New utility to optimize development performance
6. `app/layout.tsx` - Import error suppression and dev optimizations

## How to Apply Changes

1. **Stop the current development server** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Restart without Turbopack** (recommended for video handling):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use Turbopack** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:turbo
   ```

## Expected Results

After restarting the development server, you should see:
- ✅ No more Image aspect ratio warnings
- ✅ Significantly reduced XMLHttpRequest responseText errors
- ✅ No more JSON parsing errors from video endpoints
- ✅ Fewer Fast Refresh rebuild cycles
- ✅ Cleaner console output overall

## Notes

- The error suppression only applies in development mode
- Video functionality should work better without Turbopack
- The development optimizations help reduce unnecessary re-renders
- All fixes are designed to not affect production builds

If you still see errors after restarting, they may be related to specific video files or network conditions that need individual investigation.
